# session-title.sh — UserPromptSubmit wrapper for session-title.py
#
# Scaffolded by MinSpec (`MinSpec: Initialize SDD Structure` / `Refresh Harness
# Files`) into every Claude-Code-using project, and registered as a
# `UserPromptSubmit` hook in .claude/settings.json.
#
# Thin wrapper: the real logic lives in the .py so the JSON envelope on stdin
# reaches it cleanly (a `python3 - <<HEREDOC` form would steal stdin). Resolves
# the .py as its own sibling, so the pair works from whatever directory the
# harness scaffolds it into.
#
# Opt out for a session with MINSPEC_SESSION_TITLE_OFF=1.
