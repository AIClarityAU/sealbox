# Issue label vocabulary — sealbox

The labels MinSpec's triage step classifies against. **This file is documentation and a
copy-paste script — MinSpec never creates, edits, or reads a label on any forge.** Core
functionality works offline and makes no network call without your explicit consent, so
applying these is always a command *you* run.

Triage reads an issue's **type label** as one of its inputs. A type it is told to
recognise but that does not exist as a label is an input that is always absent — the
classification then rests on body text alone. That is the gap this file closes.

## Type — what kind of work is this?

Exactly one per issue.

| Label | Meaning | Auto-buildable? |
|---|---|---|
| `bug` | Something is broken | ✅ |
| `feat` | New capability | ✅ |
| `chore` | Maintenance, no behaviour change | ✅ |
| `refactor` | Structure changes, behaviour does not | ✅ |
| `test` | Test coverage or harness | ✅ |
| `ci` | Build or CI pipeline | ✅ |
| `docs` | Developer-facing documentation | ✅ |
| `idea` | Not yet a decision | ❌ human-only |
| `decide` | Asks for a product or architecture decision | ❌ human-only |
| `copy` | User-facing wording | ❌ human-only |
| `marketing` | Marketing content | ❌ human-only |
| `positioning` | Product positioning, public claims | ❌ human-only |
| `legal` | Legal, licensing, compliance | ❌ human-only |
| `monetization` / `billing` | Pricing, billing, revenue | ❌ human-only |

**Human-only is about AUTHORSHIP, not difficulty.** It says who may *write* the work, never
who may permit it — so no approval, keystroke, or configuration value lifts it. A trivial
one-word copy change is still human-only; a large mechanical refactor is not.

## Priority

`P1` (now) · `P2` (next) · `P3` (someday). Absent means untriaged.

## Lifecycle

`inbox` (awaiting triage) · `needs-review` (a human must look before work starts) ·
`needs-info` (cannot be sized yet) · `agent-ready` (cleared to build).

**`agent-ready` is the gate's OUTPUT, never its input.** Do not pre-apply it — from an
issue template, an automation, or by hand. A label that anyone can set is not a permission,
and treating it as one is how unreviewed work gets built.

## Create them

Run once, in the repo:

```bash
gh label create bug --color d73a4a --description "Something is broken" --force
gh label create feat --color a2eeef --description "New capability" --force
gh label create chore --color cfd3d7 --description "Maintenance, no behaviour change" --force
gh label create refactor --color cfd3d7 --description "Structure changes, behaviour does not" --force
gh label create test --color cfd3d7 --description "Test coverage or harness" --force
gh label create ci --color cfd3d7 --description "Build or CI pipeline" --force
gh label create docs --color 0075ca --description "Developer-facing documentation" --force
gh label create idea --color d4c5f9 --description "Not yet a decision" --force
gh label create decide --color b60205 --description "Human-only: asks for a product or architecture decision" --force
gh label create copy --color b60205 --description "Human-only: user-facing wording" --force
gh label create marketing --color b60205 --description "Human-only: marketing content" --force
gh label create positioning --color b60205 --description "Human-only: positioning, public claims" --force
gh label create legal --color b60205 --description "Human-only: legal, licensing, compliance" --force
gh label create monetization --color b60205 --description "Human-only: pricing, billing, revenue" --force
gh label create billing --color b60205 --description "Human-only: billing (sibling of monetization)" --force
gh label create P1 --color b60205 --description "Now" --force
gh label create P2 --color fbca04 --description "Next" --force
gh label create P3 --color 0e8a16 --description "Someday" --force
gh label create inbox --color ededed --description "Awaiting triage" --force
gh label create needs-review --color fbca04 --description "A human must look before work starts" --force
gh label create needs-info --color fbca04 --description "Cannot be sized yet" --force
gh label create agent-ready --color 0e8a16 --description "Cleared to build — the gate's output, never its input" --force
```

`--force` updates a label that already exists rather than failing, so the block is safe to
re-run after editing a description.

## Changing this file

Edit it freely. Refresh preserves sections you add and updates the ones above; a section
MinSpec does not know about is kept as-is at the end.
