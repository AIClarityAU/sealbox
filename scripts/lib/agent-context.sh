# scripts/lib/agent-context.sh — the ambient context every headless agent starts with.
#
# Single source of truth for the setting sources a dev-time `claude -p` run loads.
# Source it, then expand "${AGENT_CONTEXT_ARGS[@]}" in the invocation.
#
# ── Why this exists (#912 recurrence: the drain's autocompact halt) ────────────
# `claude -p` injects the DISCOVERED SUBAGENT ROSTER into the conversation as an
# `agent_listing_delta` ATTACHMENT. That is not part of the system prompt, so
# #912's `--system-prompt-file` context-slim fix — which does suppress the
# ambient CLAUDE.md/memory load — never touched it.
#
# On the operator box that hit this, `~/.claude/agents/` holds 272 definitions:
# 83,599 bytes, ~21k tokens, PER INJECTION. And the attachment is re-injected
# AFTER EVERY AUTOCOMPACT, which is the entire failure mode — compaction frees
# the window and the roster immediately refills it. Three rounds of that trip the
# harness's own abort:
#
#   "Autocompact is thrashing: the context refilled to the limit within 3 turns
#    of the previous compact, 3 times in a row."
#
# Measured identically across four crashed dispatches (#1101, #1099, #1132,
# #1189): exactly 4 roster injections and 3 compact summaries per run — ~334 KB
# of roster in one build. EVERY dispatched build died this way, which is what
# tripped drain-inbox.sh's autocompact circuit-breaker 3/3 and halted dispatch.
# The breaker was correct; it was reporting a real, systemic outage.
#
# The roster is pure dead weight to these runs: dispatch-issue.sh's ALLOWED_TOOLS
# grants no Agent/Task tool and no role prompt asks for a subagent, so the run
# cannot use a single agent it is paying ~21k tokens x4 to be told about.
#
# ── What this changes, and what it deliberately does not ──────────────────────
# `--setting-sources project,local` drops USER scope. Measured: 83,599 -> 3,201
# bytes (-96%; only the built-in agents remain).
#
#   * PROJECT scope is KEPT ON PURPOSE. The repo's own `.claude/settings.json`
#     (spec-gate.sh, marker-guard.mjs) is COMMITTED, so it is present in every
#     agent worktree and keeps loading. No MinSpec gate is weakened here — that
#     is the constitution's no-silent-gate invariant, so it is not negotiable.
#   * AUTH-NEUTRAL. Credentials do not live in settings, and the subscription
#     OAuth path is preserved — verified by a probe run that completed normally
#     under these sources. Unlike `--bare`, which forces ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and
#     would break subscription-default billing (DR-016/017).
#   * It does NOT drop `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE`. An earlier version of
#     this comment claimed it did — that was wrong, and the correction matters:
#     `--setting-sources` selects which settings FILES load, and cannot unset a
#     variable that is already exported in the process environment. The override
#     is inherited (session -> drain -> dispatch -> `claude -p`), so it survives
#     any file-source selection. Removing it needs an explicit `env -u`, which is
#     what AGENT_ENV_SCRUB below does. Do not delete that scrub as redundant.
#   * User-scope hooks stop applying to headless runs (terminal naming, the
#     caveman output-style hook, the primary-checkout guard). That is correct
#     here: the agent runs in an isolated /tmp worktree and its allowlist admits
#     only `git add`/`git commit`-prefixed commands, so it has no path to the
#     primary checkout the guard protects.
#
# Kill-switch, no code change:
#   MINSPEC_AGENT_SETTING_SOURCES=user,project,local   restore the pre-fix shape
#   MINSPEC_AGENT_SETTING_SOURCES=""                   omit the flag entirely
#
# Enforced by packages/minspec/tests/agent-context-slim.test.ts — a new launcher
# that forgets the flag silently restores the outage, so a comment here is not
# enough ("enforce, don't trust the model").

# ── Inherited-environment scrub (#1203) ───────────────────────────────────────
# `--setting-sources` above selects which settings FILES load. It cannot unset a
# variable that is already exported in the process environment, and one of those
# is actively harmful to a headless build:
#
#   CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=55
#
# It reaches every dispatched agent by inheritance — VS Code session ->
# drain-inbox.sh -> dispatch-issue.sh -> `claude -p` — and makes the run compact at
# 55% of its window instead of the default. That roughly halves the usable span
# between compactions, which is precisely the condition that turns an ordinary
# large file read into "the context refilled to the limit within 3 turns of the
# previous compact" and aborts the build.
#
# Verified on a LIVE dispatched agent, not inferred:
#   $ tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/<agent>/environ | grep AUTOCOMPACT
#   CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=55
# and run #1067 showed 8 compact summaries from 28 entries totalling ~60 KB — a
# volume that cannot fill a 200k window once, let alone eight times.
#
# It is a legitimate INTERACTIVE preference, so it is scrubbed only for headless
# agents; the operator's own sessions are untouched.
#
# Deliberately NOT scrubbed here: ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL (the scrooge tee-proxy, a
# deliberate measurement instrument) and CLAUDE_EFFORT (a cost/behaviour choice,
# not a correctness bug). Removing either as a side effect of a thrash fix would
# be an unrelated silent change.
#
# Kill-switch: MINSPEC_AGENT_ENV_SCRUB=0 inherits the environment verbatim.
