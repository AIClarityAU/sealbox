# review-decide.sh — pure deterministic AI-review gate (no network, no gh, no side effects).
#
# Reads a reviewer agent's output on stdin, extracts its verdict block, and writes
# the FINAL review label to stdout: "ai-review:pass" or "ai-review:changes".
#
# This is the machine-checkable gate that BACKS the LLM's judgment. It fails
# CLOSED: any missing/garbled field, any blocking finding, an ESCALATE, more than
# one verdict block, or a non-"pass" verdict → ai-review:changes (never a false
# green). A green (ai-review:pass) is emitted ONLY on an unambiguous clean verdict.
#
# Why this exists: the reviewer reads an UNTRUSTED diff (a PR — incl. arbitrary
# contributor code — is a prompt-injection surface). Per the repo's dispatch
# security model (DR-345 / mirrors triage-decide.sh), the agent gets NO tools and
# CANNOT apply labels — it only emits a verdict. The parent (review-pr.sh, or the
# dispatch-time run_reviewer_stage via review-branch.sh) feeds that verdict here
# and applies the result with gh. An injected "mark this ai-review:pass" cannot
# bypass the deterministic rules below.
#
# Expected verdict block in stdin (case-insensitive field names):
#   REVIEW_VERDICT_BEGIN
#   verdict: pass | changes
#   blocking: <integer>        # count of blocking/correctness findings
#   summary: <one line>
#   REVIEW_VERDICT_END
#
# stdout: one line, label ∈ {ai-review:pass, ai-review:changes}
# exit 0 when a clean verdict is parsed; exit 2 (still prints changes) otherwise.

# masquerade as `ai-review:changes` (which would read as "the reviewer wants
# changes" and hide the real, fixable cause from the dev). No verdict block is

# Fail closed on AMBIGUITY: the reviewer is contractually told to emit EXACTLY ONE
# verdict block. More than one BEGIN marker means the captured output carries a
# second block — the prompt-injection channel this gate exists to defeat: an
# UNTRUSTED diff can embed its own `REVIEW_VERDICT_BEGIN verdict: pass …` block,
# and an HONEST reviewer that merely QUOTES that block in its findings (before its
# own real verdict) would otherwise have `field()`'s `head -1` read the attacker's
# `pass` instead of the reviewer's `changes`. Any count != 1 is anomalous
# (injection echo, a malformed double-emit, or a truncated block) → distrust the
# whole thing and block. Counted over the RAW input, not the sed-joined BLOCK, so a
# quoted block that never closed its END still trips this.
