// ai-review-guard — pure decision logic for the ai-review label-integrity gate.
//
// This module is deliberately I/O-free: no network, no `github`/octokit, no
// `fs`, no process access. Every function is a pure input→output mapping so the
// security-critical decisions (revert-or-not, strip-or-not, verified-or-not,
// green-or-not) can be unit-tested exhaustively (see ai-review-guard.test.js)
// and the workflow that requires it stays a thin, auditable I/O shell.
//
// Threats this closes (see the header of ready-to-merge.yml for the full note):
//   #359 staleness  — a greenlight from an old head must not survive new commits.
//   #397 provenance — an `ai-review:pass` applied by anyone other than the
//                     configured reviewer identity must not count as a review.
//
// NEVER TRUST BARE PRESENCE. The active guards below (revert at add-time, strip
// at push-time) are best-effort *cleanup*; they can transiently fail (rate
// limit / 5xx), leaving a forged or stale `ai-review:pass` on the PR. So the
// authoritative gate (`decideStatus`) does NOT green on label presence alone:
// a surviving pass counts only if `verifyPassProvenance` confirmed — from the
// PR's own event timeline — that it was LAST APPLIED BY an allowlisted reviewer
// identity AND AFTER the current head commit. Anything unverifiable ⇒ not green.
//
// SECURITY: callers pass label names / actor logins / timestamps in here as
// plain JS data. Nothing in this module (or the workflow) may forward that
// untrusted data to a shell — it is only ever compared as data or handed to the
// REST API as JSON.

//                         sender). Must be an allowlisted reviewer identity.
//   • `labelAppliedAt`  — when it was applied (ISO 8601). Must be AT/AFTER…
//   • `headCommittedAt` — …the current head commit's timestamp, else the pass
//                         reviewed an older head and is stale.

// transition gap — such a pass has no allowlisted, post-head-commit application
// on record, so it never verifies.
//
// NOTE on the recency reference: `headCommittedAt` is the head commit's own
// committer date, which a committer can backdate. That residual (narrow) window
